# UMinho

So, as it turns out, I got a university degree (*I know right? I'm shocked myself...*). Well, I recently got a BSc in Computer Engineering, now halfway through my master's, at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/).

Here's a shiny logo:

Anyway, I've been using git for pretty much all of the course, but the repos have been scattered around GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab. Well, here they are, all put together.

Pretty much every line of code is a mess because we f\*cking n00bs learning, so don't get your hopes up.

If you're a Computer Engineering student looking at this, the projects will *probably* help you, especially because every now and then the professors hand over the same project assignments. If you need help through any part or if you need to find out what was the assignment we were supposed to do, your best bet is probably to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fribmendes) or whatever.

**BSc**:

* **1st year**: nope. We had a couple of projects but I don't where they are anymore.
* **2nd year**:
  - [Software Labs III](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/02/LI3) - a publication management software done twice in C and Java.
  - [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/02/POO) - a sample fitness app. *First time with Java... Oh, the memories...*
  - [Operating Systems](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/02/SO) - concurrent voting poll using multiple processes
* **3rd year**:
  - [Software Systems Development & Databases](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/03/DSS_BD) - a Habitat For Humanity management thingy.
  - [Distributed Systems](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/03/SD) - stock management software
  - [Computer Graphics](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/03/CG) - a solar system. With a teapot that's also a meteor \\m/
  - [Computer Communications](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/03/CC) - we didn't even finish this one. We were supposed to make a game that broadcasted songs across multiple clients or something.
  - [Language Processing & Compilers](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/03/PL) - We started off with a small set of projects using Flex and ended up with a small language that runs on a stack-based VM.
  - [Knowledge and Reasoning Representation Systems](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/03/SRCR) - Artifical Intelligence. A set of projects using Prolog to represent knowledge and neural networks for the reasoning part.

**MSc**:
  * **1st year/4th year**: We have to choose two specialties. I chose Distribued Systems and Cryptography and also Application Engineering. More projects will be added here in the future (I hope).
    - [Distributed Systems Paradigms](https://github.com/frmendes/uminho/tree/master/04/PSD) - We started with a small set of TCP chats using multiple technologies (callback-based app and promises) and ended up with a small IRC-like application (this also has actor-based programming and ZeroMQ, which is pretty sweet).
    - [Distributed Systems Paradigms pt 2](https://github.com/JoRod94/dsc-bank-service-rmi) - We had to implement a bank service using RMI in Java.
